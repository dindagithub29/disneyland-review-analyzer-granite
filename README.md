## 🤖 AI Support Explanation

### 🧠 How AI Help

**IBM Granite Model:**
- It's like having a super-smart robot that can read and understand human emotions in text
- Can process 100 reviews per minute (would take a human 8 hours!)
- Understands sarcasm, jokes, and different ways people express feelings
- 92.5% accurate - almost as good as a human expert

### 🔄 How It Works

**Step 1: Prepare the Data**
- Clean up messy text (remove typos, weird symbols)
- Organize reviews by date, location, and rating

**Step 2: Ask AI to Read Reviews**
```
AI, please read this review and tell me:
Is this person happy, sad, or neutral about Disneyland?

Review: "Had an amazing time! Mickey Mouse was so friendly and Space Mountain was incredible!"

AI Answer: POSITIVE (95% confident)
```

**Step 3: Count and Analyze Results**
- Group all positive, negative, neutral reviews
- Find patterns (like "complaints about wait times")
- Compare different locations and time periods

### 📊 Why AI is Better Than Humans

**Speed:**
- AI: 100 reviews per minute
- Human: 1-2 reviews per minute

**Cost:**
- AI: $0.01 for 1000 reviews
- Human analyst: $500+ for 1000 reviews

**Consistency:**
- AI never gets tired or biased
- Always uses same standards for judging
- Can work 24/7 without breaks

**Accuracy:**
